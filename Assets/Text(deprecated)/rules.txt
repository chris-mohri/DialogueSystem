1. to denote the end of a chapter, make another entry and set the name to ".END" (you can leave everything else empty)
2. use <line-indent=15%> if you want to indent stuff. see tmpro rich text for other tips and tricks. just don't use the id tags or you might break my code :(
3. persist function = a type of func that allows the player to start new dialogue while this func is still executing. Call functions like PersistMove() or PersistFunc() (have 'Persist' at the beginning)


TODO
1. make it so text continues via click only if the a certain region on the screen is clicked
2. DONE next page functionality
3. add a blinking marker at the end of the current sentence. 
4. DONE change .json logic so it automatically adds the dialogueEntries: { }
5. DONE buggy when adding text (spam multiple letters at same time) ingame through the editor 
6. for moving a sprite. initially, store current x and y and calculate end point. 
7. DONE combine .func .func when in same block?
8. DONE bug to fix: double clicking on same option will also count for the new option (if same id)
9. underline selects the y position of the number (1. or 2. ), though it should select position of the line instead
10. movement skip infrastructure
11. remove .json support
