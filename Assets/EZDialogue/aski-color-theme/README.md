# How to Use
Here's a quick way to get a custom color scheme for the .aski files. 

1. Copy the aski-color-theme folder into the MicrosoftVsCode/resources/app/extensions folder. 
2. In your main directory for your unity project, open your `settings.json` file by pressing ctrl+shift+p and typing in `Open Workspace Settings (JSON)`
3. Copy this line into the file `"workbench.colorTheme": "Aski Color"` whenever you want to turn on the color scheme when editing .aski files
    Annoyingly there is no way to automatically apply the theme when opening a .aski file, so you'll have to comment/uncomment this line out when switching between .aski and other files :(
4. UPDATE - you can download the extension Theme by language by Julien Saulou to automatically apply the color themes. Intuitive instructions in the extension's description
