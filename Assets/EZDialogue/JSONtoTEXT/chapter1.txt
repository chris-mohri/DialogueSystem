	.say A hot, earthenware pot sat on the table.

	.say Aoko spat out complaints to no one in particular as she plucked food from it with her chopsticks.

	.say When it came to the kind of Japanese hotpot where all one had to do was buy and boil ingredients, it was usually Aoko's responsibility.

	.say The egg she had plucked was still as silky as a baby's bottom, so she returned it to the pot.

	.say Her expression stated that she had no interest nor opinion on the matter, but she at least appeared to be listening.
